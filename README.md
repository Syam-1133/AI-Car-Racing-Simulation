# ðŸš— AI Car Racing Simulation  

An **AI-powered car racing simulation** built with **Python** and **Pyglet**.  
This project demonstrates how **neural networks** and **genetic algorithms** can work together to evolve self-driving cars that learn to navigate a racetrack over time.

## ðŸŒŸ Features  
- **AI Cars**: Each car is controlled by a lightweight **feedforward neural network** ("brain").  
- **Virtual Sensors**: Cars use **5 radars** to sense distances to the track edges.  
- **Genetic Algorithm**:  
  - Selection â†’ Best cars are chosen.  
  - Crossover â†’ Neural networks are combined.  
  - Mutation â†’ Random tweaks are introduced.  
- **Progressive Learning**: Cars evolve from random driving to skilled track navigation.  
- **Visualization**: Real-time rendering of cars, track, checkpoints, and neural activity.  
- **Replay System**: Best-performing models can be saved and replayed later.

## ðŸ§  How It Works  
1. **Initialization**: Cars begin with randomly generated neural networks.  
2. **Sensing**: Each car has **5 radars** that measure distances to nearby walls.  
3. **Decision Making**:  
   - Inputs (radar distances) â†’ Neural Network â†’ Outputs (steering & acceleration).  
4. **Fitness Evaluation**: Cars earn a score based on distance traveled and checkpoints crossed.  
5. **Evolution Process**:  
   - The top cars are kept.  
   - Crossover and mutation create new offspring.  
   - Weak performers are replaced.  
6. **Learning**: Over generations, cars gradually learn how to follow the track.
