# AI Car Racing Simulation

This project is an interactive AI car racing simulation built with Python and Pyglet. It demonstrates how neural networks and genetic algorithms can be used to evolve self-driving cars that learn to navigate a racetrack.

## üöó Project Overview

- **AI Cars**: Each car is controlled by a neural network ("brain") that receives input from virtual sensors (radars) and outputs steering and acceleration commands.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: The best-performing cars are selected, crossed over, and mutated to create new generations that improve over time.
- **Visualization**: The simulation is visualized using Pyglet, showing the racetrack, cars, checkpoints, and neural network activity.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Simulation**: Cars start with random neural networks and attempt to drive around the track.
2. **Sensing**: Each car uses 5 radars to sense the distance to the track edge.
3. **Decision Making**: The neural network processes radar inputs and outputs acceleration and steering.
4. **Evolution**: After each round, the best cars are selected, and their neural networks are evolved to form the next generation.
5. **Learning**: Over many generations, cars learn to drive better and reach more checkpoints.

## üèÅ Getting Started


### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- [Pyglet](https://pyglet.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (`pip install pyglet`)

**No external machine learning libraries are used!**

This project is implemented using only pure Python and the built-in `math` module. There is no use of numpy, pytorch, tensorflow, or any other ML/AI libraries. All neural network and genetic algorithm logic is written from scratch 

### Running the Simulation

1. **Train the AI Cars**  
   Run the training script to evolve the car controllers:
   ```bash
   python training.py
   ```

2. **Test the Best Cars**  
   After training, watch the best cars drive using:
   ```bash
   python testdrive.py
   ```

### Controls

- Press `ESC` to stop the simulation.

## üìù Code Details

### `canvas.py`
Handles the main simulation window, drawing the track, cars, checkpoints, and HUD. Manages the simulation loop and user input.

### `car.py`
Defines the `Car` class, which uses 5 radars to sense the environment. The car's neural network receives these inputs and outputs acceleration and steering.

### `network.py`
Implements a simple feedforward neural network. Supports serialization/deserialization for use with the genetic algorithm.

### `evolution.py`
Implements the genetic algorithm: selects the best cars, performs crossover and mutation, and generates new networks for the next generation.

### `racetrack.py`
Loads the racetrack image, overlay, and checkpoints. Provides a method to check if a car is on the road.

### `hud.py`
Draws the heads-up display, showing simulation stats and a visualization of the neural network's activity.

### `storage.py`
Handles saving and loading the best neural network weights (chromosomes) to/from a JSON file.

### `training.py`
Main script for training the AI cars. Runs multiple generations, evolving the networks each time, and prints stats after each round.

### `testdrive.py`
Loads the best saved networks and lets you watch them drive (no evolution).

## üìö Example

- Cars start with random behavior and quickly crash.
- Over generations, some cars learn to follow the track and reach more checkpoints.
- The best-performing neural networks are saved and can be replayed.
